# CCTV Recap

It takes cctv footage as a Input and provide a small video as output from which we can recap the whole footage in less period of time.

One of the major problem for the CCtv survillence is if we have to watch particular activity then we have to watch the whole footage of 24 hours. If we can see that same footage in less amount of time then it will be easier to watch and find. My project based on Computer Vision helps in that. It overlaps the multiple frames in single frame and cover multiple seen in one frame by that we can make a video which will be of less time and covers all frame.

It was based on Computer vision. Used background subtraction for the detection of moving object in a frame. And generated a algorithm to overlap multiple frame into one frame with a timestamp. See project Rapid CCtv Recap.
